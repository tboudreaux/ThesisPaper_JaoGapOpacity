\section*{Response to the referee}
% General intro text goes here
We thank the referee for their critical assessment of our work. In the
following we address their concerns point by point. All changes made to the
manuscript have been boldfaced.

% Point one description 
\begin{point}
	Since neither set of models using the two different opacity tables provide a
	good match to the properties of the Jao gap, the possibility that the
	convective kissing instability is not the correct explanation for the gap
	has to be considered.

	The first paper to offer an explanation for the existence of the gap (MacDonald
	\& Gizis 2018) states 'Convective mixing is treated as a diffusion process
	with the diffusion coefficient determined from mixing length theory.' and
	'The fully implicit nature of our code also prevents the convective kissing
	instability discovered and described by van Saders \& Pinsonneault (2012).'
	The treatment of convective mixing as a diffusion process is probably the
	reason why MacDonald \& Gizis find a single episode of convection zone
	merger (for models in which merger occurs) and hence a single dip in the
	luminosity function, which seems to be the case for the Jao gap (inferred
	from figure 1 of this paper).

	In contrast, the use of instantaneous mixing leads to multiple episodes of
	convection zone merger and this could be the reason why the authors find
	two dips in the luminosity function (inferred from their figures 7 and 8).
	The authors need to give in the paper a convincing argument as to why the
	instantaneous mixing approximation is valid, particularly as using the
	diffusion approach seems to more physically consistent with current
	understanding of turbulent mixing. This should involve estimates using
	mixing length theory of the mixing time scale at all stages of the merger,
	with special attention to mixing time scales within one mixing length on
	either side of the point of contact between the merging convection zones.
	This region is where the mixing time scale is most likely to be the
	longest.

	The mixing time scale then needs to compared to other relevant time scales
	including the time scale for deuterium to come into equilibrium and the
	time scale at which the helium-3 abundance is modified by nuclear
	reactions.

	If it turns out that the instantaneous mixing approximation is not valid, then
	there needs to be discussion of alternative approaches and their
	consequences. The thrust of the paper could be changed to show that the CKI
	is not the correct explanation of the gap.
\label{pt:timescale}

% Our reply
\begin{reply}
	We respectfully disagree with the referee that a diffusive model of
	convective mixing should be preferred over an instantaneous model of
	convective mixing. Much of the following has been included as text in the
	manuscript.

	% As the referee says the primary point to clarify here is the ratio of the
	% overturn timescale to the timestep length. DSEP treats convective mixing
	% instantanously throught a single shell and we evolve models composed of
	% 5000 radial shells. Convective overturn timescales for M-dwarfs have not
	% insignifigant uncertanties on them (with different sources reporting
	% overturn times between 70 and 300 days). Therefore, for a single shell the
	% overturn timescale will be of order $10^{5}$s. However, all of these
	% estimates are order of magnitude shorter than the time steps used (which
	% bottom out at around 1 Myr). Specifically, K\"apyl\"a 2021 presents
	% hydrodynamical simulations of fully convective stars and find that the
	% overturn times are on the order of $10^{7}$s (Their Table 1). Therefore,
	% convective mixing is extremly well approximated by instantanious mixing.

	Chabrier \& Baraffe 1997 identify that an instantaneous mixing model of
	convection may have a strong suppressing effect on a models luminosity. The
	root cause of this effect is the build up of a deuterium gradient in a
	models core when the mixing timescale is significantly longer than the
	deuterium burning timescale. Chabrier \& Baraffe estimate the mixing
	timescale for a fully convective star ($\sim 0.1M_{\odot}$) is 10$^{8}$.
	However, these estimates relied on the mixing length approximation of
	convection and make use of assumptions only valid in super-adiabatic regions
	(estimating the velocity of turbulent eddies as $(\nabla -
	\nabla_{adb})^{1/2}$). Whereas, in 1997 these estimates were the best
	available, currently hydrodynamical approximations, which are more
	physically motivated and more accurate, should be preferred. These
	hydrodynamical approximations of the mixing timescale are an order of
	magnitude shorter than those Chabrier and Baraffe estimate ($10^{7}$s
	compared to $10^{8}$s). Moreover, Chabrier and Baraffe make use of the
	mixing time over the entire radius of the star (the overturn time).
	However, when judging the efficacy of an instantaneous mixing approximation
	the more relevant timescale is the mixing time over one shell. For the
	configuration we evolve models using (with 5000 shells), the mixing time
	over one shell will be of order $10^4$s. This is now much shorter than the
	deuterium lifetime against proton capture. Therefore, the deuterium
	gradient predicted in Chabrier \& Baraffe --- which MacDonald \& Gizis 2018
	address through use of a diffusive model of convection --- will not build up
	and need not be accounted for.

	In addition to these timescale arguments, we direct the referee to recent
	work conducted by the MESA collaboration (Jermyn et al. 2022 Figure 2 \&
	private communication with Aaron Dotter - Figures ). MESA has recently
	implemented time dependent convection (TDC) in addition to standard mixing
	length theory (MLT) making use of instantaneous mixing. The models
	presented in Figures \ref{fig:MESA1} and \ref{fig:MESA2} are for stars
	within the Jao Gap (identified in MESA in Mansfield \& Kroupa 2021). Note
	the extreme similarity between the instantaneous approximation and the time
	dependent convective models. Additionally, in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:MESA2}
	note that both the MLT and TDC models show periodic dips in the core $^{3}$He
	mass fraction, as is predicted by CKI.

		\label{fig:MESA2}
	\end{figure}

	For both of these reasons we content that an instantaneous mixing model of
	convection is a good approximation in this instance and that the results
	we present, showing kissing instability, are valid.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
	The convective mixing method used by MacDonald \& Gizis needs to be properly
	described along with the resulting differences from using instantaneous
	mixing.
	\label{pt:address}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	Additional text has been added to the paper addressing the results of
	MacDonald \& Gizis. 
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
	On line 184, the authors say that the OPLIB tables were created to resolve the
	discrepancy between helioseismic and solar model predictions of chemical
	abundances in the Sun. I find this to be an odd way to phrase the problem.
	Presumably the authors are referring to the difficulty of making solar
	models that match the sound speed profile (or almost equivalently the depth
	of the surface convection zone) determined by helioseismology given the
	composition constraints provided by the then recent new measurements of the
	surface abundances, notably the oxygen abundance. The authors should
	rephrase the problem and also discuss whether using OPLIB opacities help
	resolve the problem or not.
	\label{pt:seismo}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	We agree with the referee that the invocation of helioseismic discrepancies
	is confusing. Because this is not a helioseismic paper we drop from the
	text, instead just mentioning that the OPLIB tables make use of the most up
	to date physics, which is the most relevant point to our work. We do note
	here though that the OPLIB opacities did not serve to resolve any
	discrepancies.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
	The distinction between low temperature and high temperature opacity sources
	made in the paragraph beginning on line 196 is somewhat artificial.
	Presumably the transition between low temperature and high temperature
	opacity is chosen to be between $10^{4.3}$ and $10^{4.5}$ K because there
	is where the Ferguson et al. opacities and OPAL opacities are close to each
	other. Perhaps the evolution could be affected if a different temperature
	range for the transition is used. The authors should stress in this section
	that as far as modeling the gap the main impact of using different
	opacities is on the radiative zone, and give the temperature and R (or
	density) ranges that are relevant to the radiative zone(s) so that the
	reader can see from figure 3 the expected change in opacity, and also if
	log R = -1.5 is truly a representative value in the radiative zone.

	Also, from figure 3, it seems that the OPLIB opacities are lower than the OPAL
	opacities for temperatures greater than $10^{5.5}$ K and not $10^{5}$ K as
	stated in the figure caption and also on line 203.
	\label{pt:lowtempboundary}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	The range where DSEP ramps from low temperature to high temperature
	opacities is determined by the temperature range where molecules can start
	to form. It is important for the low temperature opacities to be the only
	opacity source by the time the first molecules start forming. We choose to
	ramp the opacity source so that there is not a hard discontinuity. This
	same ramp has been used as standard in all DSEP models since 2008, see
	Dotter et al. 2008 for further details.

	We have updated references in our paper to Log(R)=-1.5 as a good approximation
	throughout a star. For a GS98 solar composition 1 solar mass model this is
	a good approximation; however, we calculate Log(R) throughout a 0.356 solar
	mass model (the same model used to generate Figure 2 in the manuscript) and
	find that a more representative value of Log(R) is -0.79. It is not surprising
	that this value is somewhat larger given the lower mass of this model and
	the commensurately lower pressures and temperatures.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
	In section 3.2, mention is made of the solar surface Z/X ratio but the actual
	value is not given. Is it the value recently determined by Magg et al.
	(2022), Z/X = 0.0225 or some other earlier value? The authors should state
	the actual Z/X value used.

	Also, the authors need to say whether or not they include gravitational
	settling and element diffusion in their solar modeling, and if they do, say
	how it is done (e.g. are elements grouped or treated independently). The
	authors should also include discussion of how well their solar models
	replicate the sound speed profile determined from helioseismology.
	\label{pt:ZX}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	The calibrated Z/X value has been added into the text in section 3.2 along
	with clarification that we do include gravitational settling with elements
	grouped together. We do not include a discussion of sound speed in our
	manuscript. This paper is not a discussion of seismology so a diversion to that
	would be distracting for readers and out of place.
\end{reply}

\begin{point}
	Presumably, the authors use their solar calibrated models to set the mixing
	length ratio and initial abundances for their calculations of the evolution
	of models of low mass stars. Do they use primordial or present-day solar
	abundances? Why should the mixing length ratio be the same as the solar
	calibrated? There is evidence that the mixing length varies with stellar
	properties (e.g. Trampedach et al. 2014; Joyce \& Chaboyer 2018). A better
	fit to the location of the gap might be obtained by adjusting the mixing
	length ratio. The authors need to address these questions.
	\label{pt:alpha}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	We use GS98 solar abundances (Grevesse \& Sauval 1998) for all models. While, as the
	referee says, there is substantial evidence of a metallicity dependence
	for the mixing length parameter this dependence has only been calibrated
	for higher mass stars. In order to fully address this point we have run an
	additional grid of models with the mixing length parameter dramatically
	lowered ($\alpha_{ML} = 1.5$ \& $\alpha_{ML} = 1.0$). Results of that grid
	are shown in Figures \ref{fig:alphaMLML}, \ref{fig:alphaMLCMD}, and \ref{fig:alphaMLLoc}. 

	What is clear from these additional grids is that the Jao Gap location is
	sensitive to the value of the mixing length parameter with the magnitude of
	the gap being inversely proportional too the mixing length parameter
	($G_{mag} \appropto -0.15\alpha_{ML}$). Moreover, dramatically lowering the
	mixing length parameter to $\alpha_{ML} = 1.0$ does bring the location of
	the Jap Gap we model in closer agreement with the empirically measured
	location of the Gap.

	However, there is no a priori reason which we are aware of to expect the
	mixing length parameter to be so much lower in these low mass stars than it
	would be in the sun. Much of the work calling into question the use of
	solar calibrated mixing lengths in higher mass stars has identified a
	[Fe/H] dependence. Given that the population of stars which the Jao Gap has
	been identified in is relatively similar to the sun in composition
	extrapolating the empirical calibrations backward would not predict such a
	large dip in the mixing length.

	Therefore, we have modified the manuscript to include a limited discussion
	of the perils of using solar calibrated mixing length parameters, along
	with the results of our $\alpha_{ML} = 1.5$ and $1.0$ populations; however,
	we still favor the use of the solar calibrated mixing lengths. Finally, we
	have added into the conclusions a call for further work to be done
	studying the Jao Gap location as a potential calibration point for the mixing
	length of lower mass stars.

	We thank the referee for pointing us in this direction.

\begin{point}
	On trying the web interface for the OPLIB, it seems that the process of
	interpolating between rho and R is unnecessary. Once T is specified, it is
	possible to get the same set of R values as for the OPAL tables by
	specifying the starting value of rho. Then only interpolation in T is
	needed to get a table in the same form as the OPAL tables. The authors need
	to clarify why they chose their approach. Also, it would be helpful to
	include in figure 15 a line plot of fractional difference against log T for
	log R = -1.5 or a different R value if -1.5 is not found to be
	representative for the radiative zone (see point 4). \label{pt:webR}
\end{point}

\begin{reply}
	While given some fixed temperature, T, it is possible to set the density
	grid on the webform such that R is exactly specified. This is not feasible
	when using a range of temperatures and densities simultaneously.
	Specifically, because each temperature within such a range would require a
	unique density range to be specified in order to match the OPAL table R
	range. This is not a feature offered by the webform.

	The reason we avoid querying a single temperature at a time is that making
	a separate call to the TOPS webform for not just each composition but also
	each temperature in that composition would increase the traffic per OPAL
	table by a factor of 70 (from 126 calls currently to 8820). This is both
	infeasible from a runtime perspective (as opening a new call is the most
	time intensive part of the scraper as the JavaScript engine is initialized
	and would likely push the generation time of a single table from 10
	minutes to over 5 hours) and would place a significantly increased load on
	the Los Alamos servers. We have spoken with the Los Alamos team and have
	their consent to release this software with only with the current traffic
	it generates. 

	A brief description of this has been included in Appendix B.

	The vertical line on Figure 13 has been updated to reflect the more accurate 
	approximation of Log(R) = -0.79 throughout the star as opposed to -1.5.
