\begin{abstract}

	The Jao Gap, a 17 percent decrease in stellar density at M$_{G} \sim$ 10
	identified in both Gaia DR2 and EDR3 data, presents a new method to probe
	the interior structure of stars near the fully convective transition mass.
	The Gap is believed to originate from convective kissing instability
	wherein asymmetric production of He$^{3}$ causes the core convective zone
	of a star to periodically expand and contract and consequently the stars’
	luminosity to vary. Modeling of the Gap has revealed a sensitivity in its
	magnitude to a population’s metallicity primarily through opacity. Thus
	far, models of the Jao Gap have relied on OPAL high-temperature radiative
	opacities. Here we present updated synthetic population models tracing the
	Gap location modeled with the Dartmouth stellar evolution code using the
	OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities. Use of these updated opacities
	changes the predicted location of the Jao Gap by $\sim$0.05 mag as compared
	to models which use the OPAL opacities.
