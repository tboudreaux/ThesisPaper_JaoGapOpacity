\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
{\color{red} Talk About results of population synthetis, i.e. where the gap is
in OPAL vs OPLIB, show the CMD}

{\color{red} Then compare the results to observations, comment on which one
matches observations better and also how confident we can be about that}

{\color{red} Comment on if the shift in the gap location is larger or smaller
than the size o fthe gap or the shift due to other effects such as variations
in age or composition, i.e is it Significant enough to matter}

{\color{red} comment on why the gap shifts in the manner which it does, i.e the
opacities are lower. Show how for a constant opacity table increasing the
metallicity (which will also change the opacity) affetcs the gap location)}
